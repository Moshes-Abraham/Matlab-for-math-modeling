# Jerusalem

*And did those feet in ancient time*

*Walk upon England's mountains green*

*And was the holy Lamb of God*

*On England's pleasant pastures seen*

*And did the countenance divine*

*Shine forth upon our clouded hills*

*And was Jerusalem builded here*

*Among those dark Satanic mills*

*Bring me my Bow of burning Gold*

*Bring me my Arrows of Desire*

*Bring me my Spire O clouds unfold*

*Bring me my Chariots of Fire*

*I will not cease from mental fight*

*Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand*

*Till we have built Jerusalem*

*In England's green and pleasant Land*

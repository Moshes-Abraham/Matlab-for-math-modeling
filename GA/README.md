## How to configure? ##

* Change the goal function
  * Open here.m and modify the function at line 17
* If you have more than 2 inputs of the goal function, you should check and modify carefully in the function files because the codes are only support 2 inputs and I'm not intended to package this algorithm due to the limited time.
* To modify the range of the inputs, you should open bin_x.m to change the range.
